# Test Coverage Progress

## Iteration 1
- **Tested**: fingerprint.ts - deduplication produces consistent hashes regardless of timestamps/requestIds
- **Coverage**: 4.15% statements overall, fingerprint.ts at 85.18%
- **Learning**: Set up vitest + v8 coverage. fingerprint has circular ref handler (line 16) and array edge case (line 32) still uncovered - minor internal branches.

## Iteration 2
- **Tested**: config.ts - loadConfigFile correctly parses YAML with teams array
- **Coverage**: 6.14% statements overall, config.ts at 40.74%
- **Learning**: Config loading is user-critical. Still uncovered: tilde expansion, missing file handling, invalid teams validation, loadConfig() with env vars.
