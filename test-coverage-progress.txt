# Test Coverage Progress

## Iteration 1
- **Tested**: fingerprint.ts - deduplication produces consistent hashes regardless of timestamps/requestIds
- **Coverage**: 4.15% statements overall, fingerprint.ts at 85.18%
- **Learning**: Set up vitest + v8 coverage. fingerprint has circular ref handler (line 16) and array edge case (line 32) still uncovered - minor internal branches.
